<h2>Spellchecking Programs</h2>

<p>The first computer spell checker program began its development around 1957 by Les Earnest of Stanford University (Sertiadi, 2014, p. 1).  By 1971, “Les Earnest and Ralph Gorin creates the first spell checker program, which displays corrected alternatives of misspelled word that differed by one letter and small transpositions” (Patel, 2014, p. 9). These programs have progressed from merely underlining misspelled words to giving possible suggestions and autocorrecting while users type. Many digital devices support or feature spell checking functions.</p>

<p>Hass (1999) researched old and new technologies with case studies to show how these technologies are incorporated and used in people’s lives. She quoted Bijker (1995) stating “technological development and change is best understood as multidimensional , and multifaceted—a web that is built in fits and starts, and cannot be properly understood in hindsight” (as cited in Hass 1999, p. 221).
In the case of spellchecking, the “fits and starts” may be related to their reliability. Today, spell checkers are used as a first edit because they lack accuracy. Until they’re developed to catch many more spelling or grammar mistakes and distinguish between homophones through context, they may never substitute for skilled human copy or technical editors.  At present, people rely on a combination of computer spell checking and human editing.</p>
